Readme
------

This module allow users with proper permissions to upload images into drupal. Thumbnails are created
automaticaly.

Images could be posted individualy to the front page, included in stories or grouped in galleries.
Galleries are either personal, i.e linked to a user, or global to the drupal site.

Admin could administer images and set various parameters such as, among others, maximum image size,
permissions to access images or manipulate them.


Requirements
------------

This module requires ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org) or GD (http://www.boutell.com/gd)


Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables.
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < image.sql

2. Copy the image.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should automatically detect it. Enable the module in Site Configuration -> Modules.

3. There are a lot of options in admin: you should set at least imagemagick convert path for funny things on images, and some writeable directories to work. If Imagemagick is unavailable, you may use GD instead (version 2.01+ is recommended, but version 1.x should work); see http://www.boutell.com/gd/). Image manipulation (i.e. rotate, crop, etc.) is not implemented if you choose GD.

4. You can check your directory permissions in admin/image

5. Create at least a vocabulary and assign it to images, then select it as navigation vocabulary in settings. This way you'll have the gallery

6. If you want to enable personal photo galleries, remember to set right permissions to roles.
