Requirements
------------

This module requires Drupal 4 or later.


Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables.
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < image.sql

2. Copy the image.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should automatically detect it. Enable the module in Site Configuration -> Modules.

3. There are a lot of options in admin: you should set at least imagemagick convert path for funny things on images, and some writeable directories to work.
If Imagemagick is unavailable, you may use GD instead (version 2.01+. see http://www.boutell.com/gd/). Imaqge manipulation is not
implemented if you choose GD.

4. You can check your directory permissions in admin/image

5. Create at least a vocabulary and assign it to images, then select it as navigation vocabulary in settings. This way you'll have the gallery

6. If you want to enable personal photo galleries, remember to set right permissions to roles.
